Match the Color by guessing the red, green, and blue channels.

Written in javacript.<br>
Then refactored in jquery.<br>
Then rewritten in D3.<br>
![Match the Color Screenshot](/ColorPickerScreenshot.png?raw=true "Match the Color Screenshot")<br>

This was a coding exercise. I wrote the code in vanilla javascript, then refactored it in jQuery.
The difference was about 45 lines of code. (190 vs 145)

Then I rewrote it using D3 using about 170 lines of code, but including nicer transitions.
